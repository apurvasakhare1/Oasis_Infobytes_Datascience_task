📌 Internship Overview
Organization: Oasis Infobyte
Domain: Data Science
Internship ID: OIBSIP

📂 Projects List

1. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
Goal: Classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on physical measurements. 
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
Key Outcome: Demonstrated supervised learning basics with high classification accuracy. 

2. 📊 Unemployment Analysis in India
Goal: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify unemployment trends across Indian states, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Focus: State-wise comparison, Urban vs. Rural trends, and correlation between economic indicators.
Stack: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy.
Key Insight: Visualized the sharp spike in unemployment during the April–May 2020 lockdown and identified regional recovery patterns.

3. 📧 Email Spam Detection
Goal: Build a robust system to classify SMS or email messages as Ham (Safe) or Spam.
Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Technique: NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization) for converting text to numerical data.
Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn (SVC), Pandas.
Key Outcome: Achieved ~98% accuracy using a linear kernel, effectively filtering unwanted messages.
