📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python.
The analysis explores state-wise unemployment patterns, urban vs rural differences, labour participation rate, and the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment.

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights from real-world unemployment datasets.

Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv
The datasets contain information such as:
Region (State)
Date
Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
Estimated Employed
Labour Participation Rate (%)
Area (Urban/Rural)
