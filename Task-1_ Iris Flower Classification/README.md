🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica
The classification is done using machine learning based on flower measurements.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Target variable : Species

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm - SVM
For this project, I chose Support Vector Machines (SVM) because: 
High Accuracy: It is very effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Memory Efficiency: It uses a subset of training points (support vectors) in the decision function.
Versatility: Using the Kernel Trick (e.g., RBF or Linear), it can handle both linear and non-linear relationships. 

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Run iris_classification.ipynb or iris_classification.py

📊 Result
The model successfully predicts the species of iris flowers with high accuracy.

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic supervised machine learning classification problem and is suitable for beginners in data science.
